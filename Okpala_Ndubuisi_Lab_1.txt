-- Assignment 1 question 1
--For each invoice that has PaymentDate (not null), calculate and display how many days before the due 
--date the invoice was paid. More specifically, display invoiceID, invoice number,invoice date, invoice due
--date, payment date, and calculated column that is the number of days from payment date to due date
--(this column should have positive values where invoice was paid before due date, and negative if it
--was paid after due date).Display all date values without time component. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

select InvoiceID, InvoiceNumber, convert(date,InvoiceDate) as InvoiceDate, 
       convert(date,InvoiceDueDate) as InvoiceDueDate, convert(date,PaymentDate) as PaymentDate, 
       datediff(day, InvoiceDueDate,PaymentDate) as PaymentDateToDueDate from invoices
	   where PaymentDate is not null;


-- Assignment 1 Question 2
--Using InvoiceLineItems, display invoice ids together with how many lines each invoice has. 
--Include only invoices that have more than one line. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

select InvoiceID, count(*) as InvoiceCount from InvoiceLineItems 
       group by InvoiceID
	   having count(*) >1
       

-- Assignment 1 Question 3
--Add InvoiceNumber and VendorName to the previous query (you will need to join two more tables).

select Inv.InvoiceID, count(*) as InvoiceCount, I.InvoiceNumber, V.VendorName
       from InvoiceLineItems as Inv join Invoices as I on Inv.InvoiceID = I.InvoiceID
	   join Vendors as V on I.VendorID = V.VendorID
	   group by Inv.InvoiceID,I.InvoiceNumber, V.VendorName
	   having count(*) > 1

-- Assignement 1 Question 4
--Display account numbers and descriptions of all accounts from GLAccounts table that 
--are NOT referenced by any invoice line item.

select AccountNo, AccountDescription

	   group by AccountNo, AccountDescription

-- Assignment 1 Question 5
--For each vendor who has invoices display vendor ID, vendor name and the date of the most recent invoice 
--of that vendor. Display all date values without time component. Make sure all columns have meaningful headers.

select Vendors.VendorID, VendorName, convert(date, max(InvoiceDate)) as ConvertInvoiceDate
       from Vendors join Invoices on Vendors.VendorID = Invoices.VendorID
	   where Vendors.VendorID in (select VendorID from Invoices)
	   group by Vendors.VendorID, VendorName
